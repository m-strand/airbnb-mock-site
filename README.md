##Airbnb Mock Home Page  
The project is a recreation of the airbnb home page. My intention was to recreate the UI and basic UX using react and json server.

##Getting Started  
  
##Dependencies  
React 0.69  
React-dom 18.2.0  
React-Router-dom 6.3.0

Material Icons  
Google Fonts  
 

##Executing program  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Download the necessary dependencies listed above  
3. Navigate into the repository and run the following command: ```json-server --watch db.json```  
4. Assuming this command was successful, this will start up the json server so that any data can be accessed  
5. Open a new command window and navigate into the repository  
6. Run the following command: ```npm start```  
7. Wait for the project to load and it should be all set!
